# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Objective
The objective of this challenge is to create a map using different mapbox layers and earthquake overlays.

### Mapbox
Three mapbox tile layers will be created and utilized in this challenge, and include the following views:
- Street: mapbox/streets-v11
- Satellite street: mapbox/satellite-streets-v11
- Dark mode: mapbox/dark-v11

### Overlays
Additionally, there will be three overlays that will be enabled, and include the following objects:
- A view of all earthquakes 
- A view of the tectonic plates
- A view of all earthquarkes with a magnitude of 4.5 or greater

### Results
The final outcome is a map that enables you to toggle between map views and overlays
